# Luna Open API Project
The Luna Open API Project is an exploration of open-source APIs, providing an opportunity to learn, integrate, and fetch data from publicly available resources. The goal is to practice working with APIs, setting up project structure, and ensuring proper repository management while building foundational skills in web development.
Available Open Source API Options
You may choose from the following APIs to implement in this project:
 • Open-Meteo – A free weather API.
 • Swapi.Tech – An API with data about Star Wars films.
 • Marvel – An API for the Marvel fandom.
 • ARTIC – The Art Institute of Chicago’s art API.
 • TheDogAPI or TheCatAPI – APIs for dog and cat data.
 • Soccer – A soccer-focused API.
 • SampleAPIs (Deprecated) – Coffee API (certificate expired; not recommended).
Chosen API for this project: ARTIC – The Art Institute of Chicago’s Art API
Project Requirements for This Week

 1. Familiarize Yourself With the API Documentation
 • Explore the docs of the ARTIC API and understand the available data.
 2. Set Up a New GitHub Repository
 • Create a new repository specifically for Luna Open API Project.
 • Clone the repository to your local machine.
 • ⚠️ Important: Do not clone into your portfolio folder. Doing so will create a nested repository, which is unnecessarily complicated to fix.
 3. Create Basic Project Files
 • Setup  index.html ,  index.js , and  index.css .
 • Ensure that all files link properly, but keep the structure simple for now.
 4. Fetch API Data
 • Use JavaScript  fetch  to call the ARTIC API.
 • Confirm the response is working by logging the data in the console.
 • Displaying data is not required yet, only retrieval and verification.
 5. Link Back to Portfolio Project
 • Add a link in the README of your Portfolio Project so reviewers can easily find this project.
 • Example link markdown: My Open API Project(<https://github.com/yourUsernameHere/luna-open-api-project>)
Expected Outcomes
By the end of this assignment, you should have:
 • A GitHub repository created and properly connected.
 • A basic project structure ( .html ,  .css ,  .js ).
 • Verified that API fetch requests are working with logged data.
 • Linked your API project repository from your Portfolio project README.
